      We have been in the midst of a giant surveillance experiment, with governments and companies collecting and sharing data on an unprecedented scale. How comfortable are we with this?
    </p>

<p class = "fs-6">
  Three years ago, tech companies, governments, and international agencies all announced measures to help contain the spread of the COVID-19. Consumer tech has been a big part of the solutions that reached users including things like contact tracing, covid tracking, lateral reporting etc.
</p>

<p class = "fs-6">
  While some measures have been said to be voluntary, many are based in emergency powers that governments and organisations grant themselves to be able to temporarily deal with the pandemic.
</p>

<p class = "fs-6">

</p>

<p class = "fs-6">
  We need to take stock internally and within our communities to see how much data we want to share with various stakeholders? What are the personal trade-offs we are willing to make? How comfortable are we with this often unexpected sharing of our private information? </p>

    The upcoming screens are meant to help you think through what your personal preferences are about the information you want to share across contexts. </p>

    Privacy, of course, is contextual. As you move through the screens, think about who you’re okay to share information with and why.
