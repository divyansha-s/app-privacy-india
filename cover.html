  Three years ago, tech companies, governments, and international agencies all announced measures to help contain the spread of the COVID-19. Consumer tech has been a big part of the solutions that reached users including things like contact tracing, covid tracking, lateral reporting etc. While the efficacy of these can be debated, it is clear that we have been in the midst of a giant surveillance experiment, with governments and companies collecting and sharing data on an unprecedented scale. 
</p>

<p class = "fs-5">
  While some measures have been said to be voluntary, many are based in emergency powers that governments and organisations grant themselves to be able to temporarily deal with the pandemic.
</p>

<p class = "fs-5">
  Now that we’ve been living with the pandemic and consequent techno-solutionist measures for years, it is time to step back and think about these measures.
</p>

<p class = "fs-5">
  We need to take stock internally and within our communities to see how much data we want to share with various stakeholders? What are the personal trade-offs we are willing to make? How comfortable are we with this often unexpected sharing of our private information? </p>

<p class = "fs-5">

This quick exercise helps you do just that. </p>

<p class = "fs-5">
The upcoming screens are meant to help you think through what your personal preferences are about the information you want to share across contexts. </p>

<p class = "fs-5">
Privacy, of course, is contextual. As you move through the screens, think about who you’re okay to share information with and why.
